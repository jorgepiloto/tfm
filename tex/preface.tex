\chapter*{Abstract}

In this work a deep analaysis on suitable transfer orbits to discovered
interlopers is presented. By analyzing different launch scenarios, porkchop
plots for the specific energy at launch are generated for both prograde and
retrograde transfers. Isolines for the total time of flight and the velocity at
arrival are computed for a big span of launch and arrival dates. This allows for
the computation of the lowest energy transfer. Launches from Earth, Lagrange
point L2, and gravity assisted maneuvers are explored. The results obtained are
consistent with other proposed missions, like the Comet Interceptor, showing
that L2 is a good starting point for launching interstellar missions.
