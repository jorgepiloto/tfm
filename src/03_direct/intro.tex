\chapter{Direct transfer analysis}
\label{ch:direct-transfer}

This chapter presents the direct transfer analysis performed on the two
discovered interstellar objects, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The algorithm used
is the one devised by \cite{izzo2015}, as it is proven to be more accurate and
faster than other classical algorithms \cite{martinez2021}. The ephemerides for
1I/'Omuaumua and 2I/Borisov are obtained from JPL Horizons API service. These
are propagated under the two-body assumption to simplify the analysis.
Propagation starts on January 1, 2016 and ends on January 1, 2035.

The analysis includes porkchop plots for quickly visualizing different mission
constraints. The optimum transfers are computed and their figures are generated
for better undesrtanding the orbit. A short discussion on the obtained values is
presented at the end of the chapter.
