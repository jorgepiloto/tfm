\chapter{Direct transfer analysis}

This chapter presents the direct transfer analysis performed on the two
discovered interstellar objects, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The analysis
includes porkchop plots for quickly visualizing different mission constraints.
The optimum transfers are represented graphically too. A short discussion on the
obtained values is presented at the end of the chapter.
