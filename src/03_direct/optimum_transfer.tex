\section{Optimum transfer}

Once direct transfers (prograde and retrograde) have been computed for each pair
of launch and arrival dates, the most optimum transfer orbit can be identified.

It is important to define the concept of optimum transfer. In this context, this
term refers to the orbit whose launch energy is the lowest. Other mission
constrains may be considered but for the purpose of this work, the launch $C_3$
energy is the only parameter considered. The reason is that the $\Delta v_1$
required for a direct transfer is a limiting factor for nowadays technology.

Porkchps represented in figures
\ref{fig:oumuamua-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} and
\ref{fig:borisov-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} contain an optimum transfer
maneuver. This section analyzes the most optimum transfer for each interloper,
including a detailed description of the trajectory and the impulses required.

\subsection{'Oumuamua}

Among the prograde and retrogade direct transfers, the most optimum transfer is
contained in the set of prograde orbits. Analyzing figure
\ref{fig:oumuamua-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} in detail, it is possible
to limit the value of the characteristic energy at launch to ignore high speed
impulse solutions. This reveals figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-optimum-porkchop}.

        a low energy transfer is possible. The porkchop is limited up to $25$
        km/s, which is a feasible value for nowadays technology.}

The analysis is also expanded for considering the arrival velocity. This is
depicted in figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-optimum-porkchop-avl}.

reveals that the lowest
characteristic energy is the one collected in table \ref{tab:oumua-direct-transfer-optimum}.

Figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-direct-transfer-orbit} shows the trajectory of the
optimum transfer between Earth and 1I/'Oumuamua. Impulses for this maneuver are
described in table \ref{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-impulses}. Total cost is
$42.00$ km/s.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Impulse & $\Delta v_x$ [km/s] & $\Delta v_y$ [km/s] & $\Delta v_z$ [km/s] \\
    \hline
    Launch & 28.20 & -30.10 & 3.91 \\
    \hline
    Arrival & 0.28 & -0.49 & -0.02 \\

\end{table}

This scenario was analyzed by \cite{hein2018} too. However, the analysis
presented in this work expands previous article by covering the retrograde case
and providing the optimum solution.

Despite having found and optimum solution, the value of $C_3 = 720.28$
km$^2$/s$^2$ is still a high value for orbit transfers.

\subsection{Borisov}

Regarding Borisov, the most optimum transfer is also a prograde transfer. The
analysis of figure \ref{fig:borisov-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} shows
that the lowest characteristic energy is the one collected in table
\ref{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-optimum}.

Previously found literature shows that \cite{hibberd2021} analyzed the direct
transfer to the interloper, where he states that the optimum transfer happens 

Impulses for this maneuver are described in table
\ref{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-impulses}. Total cost is $36.95$ km/s.
