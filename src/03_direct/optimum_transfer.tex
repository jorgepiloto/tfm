\section{Optimum transfer}

Once direct transfers (prograde and retrograde) have been computed for each pair
of launch and arrival dates, the most optimum transfer orbit can be identified.

It is important to define the concept of optimum transfer. In this context, this
term refers to the orbit whose launch energy is the lowest. Other mission
constrains may be considered but for the purpose of this work, the launch $C_3$
energy is the only parameter considered. The reason is that the $\Delta v_1$
required for a direct transfer is a limiting factor for nowadays technology.

Porkchps represented in figures
\ref{fig:oumuamua-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} and
\ref{fig:borisov-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} contain an optimum transfer
maneuver. This section analyzes the most optimum transfer for each interloper,
including a detailed description of the trajectory and the impulses required.

\subsection{'Oumuamua}

Among the prograde and retrogade direct transfers, the most optimum transfer is
contained in the set of prograde orbits. Analyzing figure
\ref{fig:oumuamua-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} in detail, it is possible
to limit the value of the characteristic energy at launch to ignore high speed
impulse solutions. This reveals figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-optimum-porkchop}. The
analysis is also expanded for considering the arrival velocity. This is depicted
in figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-optimum-porkchop-avl}.

The values associated with the point with the lowest characteristic energy for
launching a spacecraft, indicated with a red cross in the figures, are collected
in table \ref{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-optimum}.

        km/s, which is a feasible value for nowadays technology.}

Figures \ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_xy},
\ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_yz}, and \ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_xz}
represent the trajectory of the optimum transfer between Earth and 1I/'Oumuamua.
Note how the orbit lies close to the ecliptic and has a very low inclination.
This allows to take advantage of the Earth's velocity to intercept the
interloper, reducing the required energy for the transfer.

However, a look to figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-optimum-porkchop-avl} reveals that
the arrival velocity is very high. Even if a targeting with 'Oumuamua was
attempted, the observation time would be very short. This is also evidenced by
the impulses required for the maneuver, which are collected in table
\ref{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-impulses}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Impulse & $\Delta v_x$ [km/s] & $\Delta v_y$ [km/s] & $\Delta v_z$ [km/s] \\
    \hline
    Launch & 0.98 & -1.16 & 2.54 \\
    \hline
    Arrival & 59.10 & -14.22 & 14.33 \\

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Impulses required for the optimum transfer between Earth and 1I/'Oumuamua.}
  \label{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-impulses}
\end{table}

The total time of flight is 265 days. The cost for the launch is around $2.96$
km/s, while the arrival impulse is $66.45$ km/s. The total cost for the transfer
is $65.41$ km/s.

\subsection{Borisov}

Regarding Borisov, the most optimum transfer is also a prograde transfer. The
analysis of figure \ref{fig:borisov-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} shows
that the lowest characteristic energy is the one collected in table
\ref{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-optimum}.

Previously found literature shows that \cite{hibberd2021} analyzed the direct
transfer to the interloper, where he states that the optimum transfer happens 

Impulses for this maneuver are described in table
\ref{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-impulses}. Total cost is $36.95$ km/s.

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Impulse & $\Delta v_x$ [km/s] & $\Delta v_y$ [km/s] & $\Delta v_z$ [km/s] \\

    Launch & -11.92 & 3.69 & -25.73 \\
