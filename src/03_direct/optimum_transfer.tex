\section{Optimum transfer}
\label{sec:optimum-transfer}

Once direct transfers (prograde and retrograde) have been computed for each pair
of launch and arrival dates, the most optimum transfer orbit can be identified.

It is important to define the concept of optimum transfer. In this context, this
term refers to the orbit whose launch energy is the lowest. Other mission
constrains may be considered but for the purpose of this work, the launch $C_3$
energy is the only parameter considered. The reason is that the $\Delta v_1$
required for a direct transfer is a limiting factor for nowadays technology.

Porkchps represented in figures
\ref{fig:oumuamua-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} and
\ref{fig:borisov-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} contain an optimum transfer
maneuver. This section analyzes the most optimum transfer for each interloper,
including a detailed description of the trajectory and the impulses required.

\subsection{1I/'Oumuamua}

Among the prograde and retrogade direct transfers, the most optimum transfer is
contained in the set of prograde orbits. Analyzing figure
\ref{fig:oumuamua-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} in detail, it is possible
to limit the value of the characteristic energy at launch to ignore high speed
impulse solutions. This reveals figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-optimum-porkchop}. The
analysis is also expanded for considering the arrival velocity. This is depicted
in figure \ref{fig:oumuamua-optimum-porkchop-avl}.

The values associated with the point with the lowest characteristic energy for
launching a spacecraft, indicated with a red cross in the figures, are collected
in table \ref{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-optimum}.

The total time of flight $\Delta t$ is 264 days. The total cost of the launch is
$\Delta v_\text{launch} = \Delta v_e + \Delta v_1 = 11.20 + 2.96 = 14.16$ km/s.
The arrival impulse is $\Delta v_2 = 62.33$ km/s. If the rendezvous is
considered, the total cost of the maneuver adds up to $\Delta v = 76.49$ km/s.
All the impulses are collected in table
\ref{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-impulses}.

Figures \ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_xy},
\ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_yz}, and \ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_xz}
represent the trajectory of the optimum transfer between Earth and 1I/'Oumuamua.
Note that the transfer orbit lies close to the ecliptic and has a very low
inclination. This allows to take advantage of the Earth's velocity to intercept
the interloper, reducing the required energy for the transfer.

\subsection{2I/Borisov}

Regarding Borisov, the most optimum transfer is also a prograde transfer. The
analysis of figure \ref{fig:borisov-direct-prograde-transfer-porkchop} reveals a
series of periodic regions in the lower left region. The region containing the
lowest characteristic energy is shown in figure
\ref{fig:borisov-optimum-transfer-porkchop-tof}. The analysis is expanded again
to the arrival velocity, which is shown in figure
\ref{fig:borisov-optimum-transfer-porkchop-avl}.

  \label{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-optimum}
\end{table}

The total time of flight $\Delta t$ is 470 days. The total cost of the launch is
$\Delta v_\text{launch} = \Delta_e + \Delta v_1 = 11.20 + 5.64 = 16.86$ km/s.
The arrival impulse is $\Delta v_2 = 33.00$ km/s. If the rendezvous is
considered, the total cost of the maneuver adds up to $\Delta v = 49.86$ km/s.
All the impulses are collected in table
\ref{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-impulses}.

Figures \ref{fig:optimum_borisov_orbit_xy}, \ref{fig:optimum_borisov_orbit_yz},
and \ref{fig:optimum_borisov_orbit_xz} represent the trajectory of the optimum
transfer from Earth to 2I/Borisov. Again, the transfer does not present a high
inclination, which allows the spacecraft to benefit from Earth's velocity.
