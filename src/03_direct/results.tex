\section{Results}

Results obtained in tables \ref{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-impulses} and
\ref{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-impulses} show that the direct transfers require
small launch impulses but present large arrival velocities.

Paying attention to figures \ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_xz} and
\ref{fig:optimum_borisov_orbit_xz}, it can be identified that the transfer orbits
with the lowest launch energies reach the target when this is near the ecliptic.

Bibliography proofs that the optimum direct transfer for borisov was already
computed by \cite{hibberd2021}. However, the optimum direct transfer for
'Oumuamua computed in this work could expand the work from \cite{hein2018}.

Nevertheless, these transfers do not consider perturbation effects like:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Solar radiation pressure
  \item Gravitational perturbations
  \item Escape velocity
  \item Spheres of influence (SOIs)
\end{itemize}

These effects could be considered in future works to improve the results
obtained for the direct transfers.
