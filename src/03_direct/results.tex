\section{Summary}
\label{sec:direct-results}

Results obtained in tables \ref{tab:oumuamua-direct-transfer-impulses} and
\ref{tab:borisov-direct-transfer-impulses} show that the direct transfers
require small launch impulses, once the escape velocity of Earth is overcome.
However, they present large arrival velocities. This limits the amount of
observation time when performing a targeting with the ISOs.

Paying attention to figures \ref{fig:optimum_oumuamua_orbit_xz} and
\ref{fig:optimum_borisov_orbit_xz}, it can be identified that the transfer
orbits with the lowest launch energies reach the target when this is near the
ecliptic.

Bibliography proofs that the optimum direct transfer for 2I/Borisov is the same as
the one computed by \cite{hibberd2021}. However, the optimum direct transfer for
1I/'Oumuamua computed in this work could expand the research from \cite{hein2018}.
