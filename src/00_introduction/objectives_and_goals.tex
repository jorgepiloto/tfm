\section{Objectives and goals}

The main objetive of this project is to devise suitable targetting orbits for
interstellar ojects. To achieve this purpose, the whole process is divided
into the following key objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research on interstellar objects.}
        The official definition of interstellar object is presented together
        with the official IAU nomenclature. Main discovered objects are
        presented together with their main characteristics. The importance of
        the solar apex is explained too. Finally, the state of the art of the
        research on interstellar objects is revisited.
    \item \textbf{Research on targetting orbits.}
        The main types of targetting orbits are presented, together with their
        main characteristics. The main differences between them are explained
        and the main advantages and disadvantages of each type are presented.
\end{itemize}
