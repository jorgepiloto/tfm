\section{Objectives and goals}

The main objetive of this project is to devise suitable targetting orbits for
interstellar ojects. To achieve this purpose, the whole process is divided
into the following key objectives:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Research on interstellar objects.}
        The definition of interstellar object is presented together with the
        official IAU nomenclature. The only two discovered objects,
        'Oumuamua and Borisov, are presented together with their main
        characteristics. The importance of the solar apex is explained
        too.

\item \textbf{Framework for the mission.}
        The mission is divided into three main stages: the parking orbits
        definition, the inclination matters and the parking orbits around the
        Earth-Moon and Earth-Sun Lagrange points. The Comet Interceptor mission
        is presented as a reference for the mission.
