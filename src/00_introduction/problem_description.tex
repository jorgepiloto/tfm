\section{Problem description and motivation}

The discovery of interstellar objects such as Oumuamua and Borisov within our
solar system has ignited a surge of curiosity and scientific interest. These
sub-kilometer-sized visitors, originating from distant stellar systems, present
a unique opportunity to study extraterrestrial bodies that have traversed vast
cosmic distances. Given their exceptionally high heliocentric velocities and
fleeting passage through the planetary region, there is a pressing need for the
development of ready-to-launch missions capable of intercepting them. The
motivation behind this research stems from the desire to unlock the mysteries
surrounding these enigmatic interstellar travelers, gathering invaluable data or
even returning samples from their surfaces. This pursuit not only promises to
broaden our understanding of celestial dynamics and planetary formation but also
holds profound implications for the future of space exploration and our
comprehension of the broader universe.
