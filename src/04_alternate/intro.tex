\chapter{Alternate transfers}

After the results obtained in section \ref{sec:optimum-transfer}, it is possible
now to study the possibility of using alternate transfers. The main goal of this
second analysis is to find a suitable transfer that is less expensive than a
direct transfer from the Earth. For this purpose, the following scenarios are
considered: orbits launching from a Lagrange point and gravity assisted
maneuvers.
