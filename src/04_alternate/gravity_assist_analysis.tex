\section{Gravity assist analysis}

Gravity assists are a well-known maneuver for changing the velocity of a
spacecraft by using the gravitational pull of a planet. The spacecraft flies by
the planet and gains or loses velocity depending on the relative motion of the
planet and the spacecraft. This technique is used to save fuel and time, and is
commonly used in interplanetary missions. \cite{flandro1966} makes a great
introduction about the basics of gravity assists that lead to the development of
missions like Voyayer I and Voyayer II.

This analysis only considers unpowered gravity assists, in which the spacecraft
does not lose mass or performs any propulsive maneuvers.

\subsection{Revisiting gravity assists}

The characteristic energy of a spacecraft in the heliocentric frame is given by
equation \ref{eq:helio-energy}:

\begin{equation}
        E_{\Sun} = \frac{1}{2}V_{\Sun}^2
    \label{eq:helio-energy}
\end{equation}

where $V_{\Sun}$ is the velocity of the spacecraft in the heliocentric frame.

Consider a planet moving at a speed of $V_p$ in the heliocentric frame. Assuming
a spacecraft approaches the planet with a speed of $\vec{v}_{\text{in,}\infty}$
and that it leaves the planet with a speed of $\vec{v}_{\text{out,}\infty}$,
both as seen by the planet. From the point of view of the planet,
$v_{\text{in,}\infty} = v_{\text{out,}\infty} = v_{\infty}$. Despite their
modulus being the same, the direction of these vectors is different. Thus,
$\vec{v}_{\text{in,}\infty} \neq \vec{v}_{\text{out,}\infty}$.

From the heliocentric perspective, the spacecraft approaches the planet with a
velocity $\vec{V}_{\text{in}} = \vec{V_p} + \vec{v}_{\text{in,}\infty}$ and
leaves the planet with a velocity $\vec{V}_{\text{out}} = V_p +
\vec{v}_{\text{out,}\infty}$.

The angle between $\vec{v}_{\text{in,}\infty}$ and $\vec{v}_{\text{out,}\infty}$
is known as the deflection angle, $\psi$. The speed $v){\infty}$ and the maximum
$\psi$ are related once the altitude $h = d - R_p$ of the flyby is set, being
$R_p$ the radius of the planet. This relation is exposed by equation
\ref{eq:max-deflection-angle}:

\begin{equation}
        \psi_{\max} = 2 \cdot \arcsin{\left(\frac{\mu}{\mu + {v}^{2}_{\infty}(R_p + h)}\right)}
    \label{eq:max-deflection-angle}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:deflection-angle-at-speed} is generated by solving equation
\ref{eq:max-deflection-angle} at an altitude of $h = R_p$ for different values
of $v_{\infty}$ at each planet of the solar system.
