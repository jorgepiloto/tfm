    abstract = "{From the parallaxes and proper motions of a kinematically unbiased subsample of the Hipparcos Catalogue, we have re-determined as a function of colour the kinematics of main-sequence stars.Whereas the radial and vertical components of the mean heliocentric velocity of stars show no trend with colour, the component in the direction of Galactic rotation nicely follows the asymmetric drift relation, except for stars bluer than B − V = 0.1 mag. Extrapolating to zero dispersion yields, for the velocity of the Sun with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) in km s−1, U0 = 10.00 ± 0.36 (radially inwards), V0 = 5.25 ± 0.62 (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and W0 = 7.17 ± 0.38 (vertically upwards).Parenago's discontinuity is beautifully visible in a plot of velocity dispersion against colour: the dispersion, which is essentially constant for late spectral types, decreases towards early spectral types blueward of B − V ≈ 0.61 mag.We determine the velocity dispersion tensor σ2 as function of colour. The mixed moments involving vertical motion are zero within the errors, while σ2xy is non-zero at about (10 km s−1)2 independently of colour. The resulting vertex deviations are about 20° for early-type stars and 10° ± 4° for old-disc stars. The persistence of the vertex deviation to late-type stars implies that the Galactic potential is significantly non-axisymmetric at the solar radius. If spiral arms are responsible for the non-axisymmetry, they cannot be tightly wound.Except for stars bluer than B − V= 0.1 mag, the ratios of the principal velocity dispersions are given by σ1:σ2:σ3 ≈ 2.2: 1.4: 1, while the absolute values increase with colour from σ1 ≈ 20 km s−1 at B − V = 0.2 mag to σ1 ≈ 38 km s−1 at Parenago's discontinuity and beyond. These ratios imply significant heating of the disc by spiral structure and that R0/Rd ≃ 3 to 3.5, where Rd is the scalelength of the disc.}",

title = {A Meteor of Apparent Interstellar Origin in the CNEOS Fireball Catalog},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The earliest confirmed interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, was discovered in the solar system by Pan-STARRS in 2017, allowing for a calibration of the abundance of interstellar objects of its size ∼100  m. This was followed by the discovery of Borisov, which allowed for a similar calibration of its size ∼0.4–1  km. One would expect a much higher abundance of significantly smaller interstellar objects, with some of them colliding with Earth frequently enough to be noticeable. Based on the CNEOS catalog of bolide events, we identify the ∼0.45 m meteor detected at 2014 January 8 17:05:34 UTC as originating from an unbound hyperbolic orbit. The U.S. Department of Defense has released an official letter stating that “the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory,” which we rely on here as confirmation of the object’s interstellar trajectory. Based on the data provided by CNEOS, we infer that the meteor had an asymptotic speed of v ∞ ∼ 42.1 ± 5.5 km s−1 outside of the solar system. Note that v ∞ here refers to the velocity of the meteor outside the solar system, not the velocity of the meteor outside the atmosphere. Its origin is approximately toward R.A. 49.°4 ± 4.°1 and decl. 11.°2 ± 1.°8, implying that its initial velocity vector was 58 ± 6 km s−1 away from the velocity of the local standard of rest (LSR).}

We consider both conventional (Lommel–Seeliger triaxial ellipsoid) and alternative (‘black-and-white ball’, ‘solar sail’) brightness models. With all the brightness models, some torque is required to explain the timings of the most conspicuous features – deep minima – of the asteroid’s light curve. Our best-fitting models are a thin disc (aspect ratio 1:6) and a thin cigar (aspect ratio 1:8) that are very close to being axially symmetric. Both models are tumbling and require some torque that has the same amplitude in relation to ‘Oumuamua’s linear non-gravitational acceleration as in Solar system comets whose dynamics is affected by outgassing. Assuming random orientation of the angular momentum vector, we compute probabilities for our best-fitting models. We show that cigar-shaped models suffer from a fine-tuning problem and have only 16 per cent probability to produce light-curve minima as deep as the ones present in ‘Oumuamua’s light curve. Disc-shaped models, on the other hand, are very likely (at 91 per cent) to produce minima of the required depth. From our analysis, the most likely model for ‘Oumuamua is a thin disc (slab) experiencing moderate torque from outgassing.}",

We analyze an asteroidal grazing meteor (FH1) recorded by the Finnish Fireball Network on October 23, 2022. FH1 displayed a likely hyperbolic orbit lying on the ecliptic plane with an estimated velocity excess of ∼0.7 kms−1 at impact. FH1 may either be an interstellar object, indicating a high-strength bias in this population, or an Oort cloud object, which would reinforce migration-based solar system models. Furthermore, under the calculated uncertainties, FH1 could potentially be associated with the passage of Scholz’s binary star system. Statistical evaluation of uncertainties in the CNEOS database and study of its hyperbolic fireballs reveals an anisotropic geocentric radiant distribution and low orbital inclinations, challenging the assumption of a randomly incoming interstellar population. Orbital integrations suggest that the event on March 9, 2017 (IM2) from CNEOS may have experienced gravitational perturbation during the Scholz fly-by, contingent upon velocity overestimation within the expected range. These findings suggest that apparent interstellar meteors may, in fact, be the result of accelerated meteoroid impacts caused by close encounters with massive objects within or passing through our solar system.}

abstract = {Motivated by recent visits from interstellar comets, along with continuing discoveries of minor bodies in orbit of the Sun, this paper studies the capture of objects on initially hyperbolic orbits by our solar system. Using an ensemble of ∼500 million numerical experiments, this work generalizes previous treatments by calculating the capture cross section as a function of asymptotic speed. The resulting velocity-dependent cross section can then be convolved with any distribution of relative speeds to determine the capture rate for incoming bodies. This convolution is carried out for the usual Maxwellian distribution, as well as the velocity distribution expected for rocky debris ejected from planetary systems. We also construct an analytic description of the capture process that provides an explanation for the functional form of the capture cross section in both the high- and low-velocity limits.}

journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {There is an unceasing incoming flux of extraterrestrial materials reaching the Earth atmosphere. Some of these objects produce luminous columns when they ablate during the hypersonic encounter with air molecules. A few fireballs occur each year bright enough to be detected from space. The source of these events is still a matter of debate, but it is generally accepted that they are of sporadic origin. We studied the NASA-JPL Center for NEOs Studies (CNEOS) fireball database to infer the dynamic origin of large bolides produced by meter-sized projectiles that impacted our planet. These likely meteorite-dropping events were recorded by the US Government satellite sensors. We estimated the false-positive rate and analyzed the time evolution of multiple orbit dissimilarity criteria concerning potential associations with near-Earth objects and meteoroid streams. We found that at least 16% of the large bolides could be associated with meteoroid streams, about 4% are likely associated with near-Earth asteroids, and 4% may be linked to near-Earth comets. This implies that a significant fraction of meter-sized impactors producing large bolides may have an asteroidal or cometary origin. In addition, we found at least three bolides having hyperbolic orbits with high tensile strength values. Meter-sized meteoroids of interstellar origin could be more common than previously thought, representing about 1% of the flux of large bolides. The inferred bulk physical properties suggest that the interstellar medium could bias these projectiles toward high strength rocks with the ability to survive prolonged exposure to the harsh interstellar space conditions.}

    abstract = "{A new classification scheme is introduced for comet-like bodies in the Solar system. It covers the traditional comets as well as the Centaurs and Edgeworth–Kuiper belt objects. At low inclinations, close encounters with planets often result in near-constant perihelion or aphelion distances, or in perihelion–aphelion interchanges, so the minor bodies can be labelled according to the planets predominantly controlling them at perihelion and aphelion. For example, a JN object has a perihelion under the control of Jupiter and aphelion under the control of Neptune, and so on. This provides 20 dynamically distinct categories of outer Solar system objects in the Jovian and trans-Jovian regions. The Tisserand parameter with respect to the planet controlling perihelion is also often roughly constant under orbital evolution. So, each category can be further subdivided according to the Tisserand parameter.The dynamical evolution of comets, however, is dominated not by the planets nearest at perihelion or aphelion, but by the more massive Jupiter. The comets are separated into four categories — Encke-type, short-period, intermediate and long-period — according to aphelion distance. The Tisserand parameter categories now roughly correspond to the well-known Jupiter-family comets, transition types and Halley types. In this way, the nomenclature for the Centaurs and Edgeworth–Kuiper belt objects is based on, and consistent with, that for comets. Given the perihelion and aphelion distances together with the Tisserand parameter, our classification scheme provides a description for any comet-like body in the Solar system. The usefulness of the scheme is illustrated with examples drawn from numerical simulations and from the present-day Solar system.}",

abstract = {This review discusses the unsolved problem of the detection of interstellar particles in the Earth’s atmosphere and the presence of interstellar meteors in meteor databases. Owing to the difficulties in obtaining accurate meteor measurements and, consequently, the meteoroids’ orbital parameters, the identification of interstellar meteors based on their hyperbolic excess velocities is extremely challenging. Moreover, it has to be verified whether the orbit’s hyperbolicity was not produced in the Solar System. Searches for interstellar meteors have been carried out using different observational techniques for more than a quarter of a century and, although they have produced many valuable results, not a single case of a meteor claimed to be produced by an interstellar particle has proven satisfactorily convincing. The reason rests in the constraints of the meteor observations, which we outline here, using meteor datasets obtained by various techniques.}
